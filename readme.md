#  üöÉ PTV Stops üöù
Made for a work Hack Day project.

Returns the next 3 trams headed into the city from our two closes tram stops (so we know when to leave work)

## How to Use

- Create an AWS Lambda Function with an API Gateway in front of it.
- Paste the code in `ptv_stop.rb` into AWS's online IDE.
- Paste your PTV API Developer ID and Secret Key into the Lambda Environment variable fields under `DEVID` and `KEY`
- Setup your Slack to point to the URL of your new Lambda function
- Profit!

## Want to change it?

This project could pretty easily be modified / extended to accommodate other stops.
You can get stop information, direction information and route information by inspecting
the (PTV Journey Planner)[https://www.ptv.vic.gov.au/route/services/1041/96/#] and checking out the network calls,
or just use the API.
